# C# Fundamentals Tutorial

Welcome to the C# Fundamentals Tutorial.  Every beginning C# programmer should understand these basic topics:

- [Queue](1-queue.md)
- [Sets](2-sets.md)
- [Tree](3-tree.md)

Each module will contain descriptions and examples.  At the end of each module, you will find a problem to solve on your own.  You should only look at the solution after you have attempted to solve the problem first.
